# ILoveFFmpeg

Browser-based multimedia toolkit that runs entirely in your browser using [FFmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm). No uploads, no tracking, complete privacy - your files never leave your device.

Main reason for creating this is due to quality loss when trimming in Movies&TV player apps in Windows. Name is inspired by ILovePDF.
